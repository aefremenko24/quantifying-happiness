**Note on test data**: The test data in `SampleData.json` is synthetically generated using Claude Sonnet 4.5 and does not represent real user data. The synthetic data attempts to mimic realistic patterns and correlations for development and testing purposes. All test cases and assertions are manually written and reviewed.
